# 🔧 Building APK from Tibzee React App

## ✅ What We've Done
Your React app has been successfully converted to an Android project using Capacitor! Here's what's been set up:

- ✅ Installed Capacitor core and CLI
- ✅ Initialized Capacitor project (app name: "Tibzee", package ID: "com.tibzee.app")
- ✅ Added Android platform
- ✅ Built the React app (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Synced the project (`npx cap sync`)
- ✅ Created Android project structure in `/android` folder

## 📋 Prerequisites to Build APK

### Option 1: Using Android Studio (Recommended)
1. **Download Android Studio**: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Install Android Studio** with default settings
3. **Install Android SDK** (will be prompted during installation)
4. **Set up environment variables** (usually done automatically)

### Option 2: Using Command Line Tools Only
1. **Download Android SDK Command Line Tools**: https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only
2. **Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable**
3. **Install build tools and platform**

## 🚀 Building the APK

### Method 1: Using Android Studio (Easiest)
1. Open Android Studio
2. Select "Open an Existing Project"
3. Navigate to your project folder: `C:\Users\shashanth\OneDrive\Documents\Tibzee\project\android`
4. Let Android Studio sync the project
5. Go to **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**
6. APK will be created in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Method 2: Using Command Line
```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd C:\Users\shashanth\OneDrive\Documents\Tibzee\project

# Build the React app (if you made changes)
npm run build

# Sync with Capacitor
npx cap sync

# Navigate to android folder and build
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## 📱 Installing the APK
1. **Enable Developer Options** on your Android device:
   - Go to Settings > About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Go back to Settings > Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging"

2. **Install the APK**:
   - Copy the APK file to your device
   - Install using a file manager
   - OR use ADB: `adb install app-debug.apk`

├── src/                     # React source code

└── package.json
```

## 🎯 Quick Start (If you have Android Studio)
1. Install Android Studio
2. Open the `android` folder in Android Studio
3. Click "Build > Build APK"
4. Install the APK on your device

## 📝 Notes
- The APK will be a debug version (for development)
- For production/release APK, use `assembleRelease` instead of `assembleDebug`
- The app will work offline since it's a web app wrapped in a native container
- All your React features (toast notifications, navigation, etc.) will work in the APK

## 🆘 Troubleshooting
- If you get "SDK location not found" error, install Android Studio or set ANDROID_HOME
- If build fails, try cleaning: `./gradlew clean` then `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- Make sure you have Java installed (Android Studio includes it)

## 📱 App Details
- **App Name**: Tibzee
- **Package ID**: com.tibzee.app
- **Platform**: Android
- **Type**: Hybrid (Web app in native container)
