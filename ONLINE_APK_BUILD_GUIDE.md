## 🆘 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure your `dist` folder has all the built files
2. Check that `config.xml` is in the root
3. Verify your app works in browser first: `npm run dev`
4. Try different online services if one fails

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **"Missing index.html"**: Make sure `dist/index.html` exists
- **"Build failed"**: Check `config.xml` syntax
- **"App won't install"**: Enable "Unknown Sources" on Android
